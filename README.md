# Performance_analysis_between_HTN_and_DomainIndependent_Planners

Implemented actions for Metric-FF and Fast Downward domain-independent planners using PDDL. GTPyhop has been used to implement HTN Planner's actions and procedures in the Block World State and Satellite domains.

This project involves the comparison of the performance of the aforementioned planners for a range of issue sizes and assessed it using measures including the number of nodes investigated, CPU time, and plan length.
